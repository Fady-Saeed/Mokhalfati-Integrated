## Mokhalfati
"Mokhalfati" is a mobile app for getting the cost of fine applied for a car easily with just a pic of the car license.

Each time the car owner wanted to know the fines applied on his car , he needed to get his car license and his own driving license and to open a website and enter the ID number digit by digit or maybe worse by going to the nearest traffic department to check for the fines of his
car or a car that he uses.

Using Mokhalfati, the car owner or user just needs an image of the car license identity and a mobile application
which is our product, just attaching the image in the app, it will get the information of the cost of
fine applied to the car, so saving a pic of the car license will help getting the cost of fines much
faster than usual.
